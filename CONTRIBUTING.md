Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

### How it works

This Action makes an authenticated query to the Dependency Graph Diff
API endpoint (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/dependency-graph/compare/{basehead}`)
to find out the set of added and removed dependencies for each manifest.


### Bootstrapping the project

```
git clone https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action.git
cd dependency-review-action
npm install
```

### Running the tests

```
npm run test
```

*Note*: We don't have any useful tests yet, contributions are welcome!

## Local Development

We have a script to scan a given PR for vulnerabilities, this will
help you test your local changes. Make sure to [grab a Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens) before proceeding!

```

Like this:

$ GITHUB_TOKEN=my-secret-token ./scripts/scan_pr https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/pull/3
```
