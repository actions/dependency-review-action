# dependency-review-action

This action scans your pull requests for dependency changes and will raise an error if any new dependencies have existing vulnerabilities. The action is supported by an [API endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/dependency-graph#dependency-review) that diffs the dependencies between any two revisions.

The action is available for all public repositories, as well as private repositories that have GitHub Advanced Security licensed.

## Installation

1. Add a new YAML workflow to your `.github/workflows` folder:

```yaml
name: 'Dependency Review'
on: [pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  dependency-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: 'Checkout Repository'
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: 'Dependency Review'
        uses: actions/dependency-review-action@v2
```

Please keep in mind that you need a GitHub Advanced Security license if you're running this action on private repos.

## Configuration
You can pass additional options to the Dependency Review
Action using your workflow file. Here's an example workflow with
all the possible configurations:

```yaml
name: 'Dependency Review'
on: [pull_request]
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  dependency-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: 'Checkout Repository'
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Dependency Review
        uses: actions/dependency-review-action@v2
        with:
          # Possible values: "critical", "high", "moderate", "low"
          # fail-on-severity: critical
          #
          # You can only include one of these two options: `allow-licenses` and `deny-licenses`
          #
          # Possible values: Any `spdx_id` value(s) from https://docs.github.com/en/rest/licenses
          # allow-licenses: GPL-3.0, BSD-3-Clause, MIT
          #
          # Possible values: Any `spdx_id` value(s) from https://docs.github.com/en/rest/licenses
          # deny-licenses: LGPL-2.0, BSD-2-Clause
```

### Vulnerability Severity

By default the action will fail on any pull request that contains a
vulnerable dependency, regardless of the severity level. You can override this behavior by
using the `fail-on-severity` option, which will cause a failure on any pull requests that introduce vulnerabilities of the specified severity level or higher. The possible values are: `critical`, `high`, `moderate`, or `low`. The
action defaults to `low`.

This example will only fail on pull requests with `critical` and `high` vulnerabilities:

```yaml
- name: Dependency Review
  uses: actions/dependency-review-action@v2
  with:
    fail-on-severity: high
```

### Licenses

You can set the action to fail on pull requests based on the licenses of the dependencies
they introduce. With `allow-licenses` you can define the list of licenses
your repository will accept. Alternatively, you can use `deny-licenses` to only
forbid a subset of licenses.

You can use the [Licenses
API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/licenses) to see the full list of
supported licenses. Use the `spdx_id` field for every license you want
to filter. A couple of examples:

```yaml
# only allow MIT-licensed dependents
- name: Dependency Review
  uses: actions/dependency-review-action@v2
  with:
    allow-licenses: MIT
```

```yaml
# Block Apache 1.1 and 2.0 licensed dependents
- name: Dependency Review
  uses: actions/dependency-review-action@v2
  with:
    deny-licenses: Apache-1.1, Apache-2.0
```

**Important**

* The action will only accept one of the two parameters; an error will
be raised if you provide both.
* By default both parameters are empty (no license checking is
performed).
* We don't have license information for all of your dependents. If we
can't detect the license for a dependency **we will inform you, but the
action won't fail**.

## Blocking pull requests

The Dependency Review GitHub Action check will only block a pull request from being merged if the repository owner has required the check to pass before merging. For more information, see the [documentation on protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches#require-status-checks-before-merging).
